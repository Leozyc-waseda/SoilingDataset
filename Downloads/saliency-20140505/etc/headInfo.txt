Hello, My name is Sal and I am very pleased you want to know about my inner working.
I am NuromorphicHead developed at the USC ILab laboratory. I run on
a highly optimized version of the saliency model developed by Itti
and colleagues. I attempt to find salient objects using this model and
utter responses based on their salient values. I can also recognize
objects. Thanks you for you attention.
