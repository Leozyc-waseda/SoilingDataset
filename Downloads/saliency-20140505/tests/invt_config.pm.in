# About srcdir and builddir: under "normal" conditions (where you
# unpack the a tarball or get an svn checkout and then do a
# ./configure within that directory) your srcdir and builddir will
# be the same. Given that, the difference between abs_srcdir and
# abs_top_srcdir is just as it sounds -- abs_top_srcdir will be
# something like /path/to/saliency, while abs_srcidr will be
# something like /path/to/saliency/tests, i.e. pointing to the
# "tests" subdirectory that this script lives in.

# Thus, to point at files that live in the svn repo itself and are not
# built/installed (such as scripts in bin/, or test scripts in
# tests/), you want to prefix with $invt_config::abs_top_srcdir. On
# the other hand, for files that get installed to a location specified
# by --prefix or --exec-prefix, you want to prefix with
# $invt_config::prefix or $invt_config::exec_prefix.
