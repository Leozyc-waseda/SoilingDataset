This directory is nearly empty by default.

To fill it up, you need to have doxygen and graphviz installed, after
which you should type:

  make doc

from within saliency/

You can also try:

  make doc-latex

to get a PDF version of the documentation, which will end up in
saliency/doc/latex/refman.pdf

Once you have completed a 'make doc', you can use saliency/bin/mn to
get our custom man pages. For example,

  mn Brain

see saliency/README for more information.


To get doxygen,  see http://www.doxygen.org
To get graphviz, see http://www.graphviz.org/
