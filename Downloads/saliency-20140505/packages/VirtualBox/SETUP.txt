Setting up your VirtualBox:
---------------------------

- Download the VirtualBox program from virtualbox.org and install it
  on your machine. Different versions of VirtualBox are available
  which work on Windows, Mac, Linux, etc

- Download the saliency virtual disk image. It contains a full
  Mandriva 2009 installation plus the pre-compiled and configured
  saliency software. This image is based on the Mandriva 2009 image
  found at virtualbox.wordpress.com

- Unpack the saliency virtual image using 7-Zip or similar
  program. You should now have a single file:
  saliency-mandriva-2009-x86.vdi

- Start VirtualBox. First go to "File -> Virtual Media Manager"

- Click "Add"

- Select the file saliency-mandriva-2009-x86.vdi that you downloaded
  and unpacked. Click "Ok".

- Click "New" to create a new virtual machine.

- Pick any name you like, e.g., "Saliency Machine". Select "Operating
  System: Linux" and "Version: Mandriva". Click "Next".

- Pick your base memory size (512MB should be ok) and click "Next".

- Make sure that saliency-mandriva-2009-x86.vdi is selected as boot
  hard disk. Click "Next".

- Click "Finish".

- Your Saliency Machine has been created. Depending on your host
  system, you may now be able to turn additional things on, like audio
  support, USB support, etc. See the VirtualBox manual for more info.

- Select the Virtual Machine and click the "start" green arrow to
  start it.

- Once you are booted up, double-click the "saliency-demo.sh" icon to
  give it a try. 

- Enjoy!

NOTE: I found that when creating a new virtualbox in this way,
sometimes the network does not work properly upon the first
boot-up. To correct this, just open up the Mandriva Control Center: go
to "System -> Administration -> Configure your Computer'. Enter
'toortoor' for the password. Then, under "Network and Internet", go to
the "Network Center". Adjust your network settings; often it is
sufficient to just look at them and click ok, which will restart the
network.
