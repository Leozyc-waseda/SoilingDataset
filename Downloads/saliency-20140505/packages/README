The operating system principally used for development of the iLab
Neuromorphic Vision C++ Toolkit is Mandriva Linux.

The Toolkit also compiles on Mac OS X and on Windows. See the
programmer-notes (in saliency/doc) for this.

Under Mandriva Linux, a number of packages need to be installed for
all of the functionality to be available. The package install script 
is available in this directory with "mandriva<version>_install.sh".
See programmer-notes in saliency/doc for the basic packages.

There is also a setup script("mandriva<version>_setup.sh") for 
new Mandriva machine. It will prepare all necessary configuration 
for Mandriva OS such as setup NIS server and fix some knowing bugs.

In this directory, .spec files are provided to build your own RPMs
when they are not readily available in mainstream distribution
sources.

Under Debian run 
dpkg --set-selections < debian.pkgs
apt-get dselect-upgrade

Under Ubuntu run
ubuntu<version>_install.sh
