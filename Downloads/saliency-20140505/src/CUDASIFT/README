The data structures for SIFT keypoints are slightly different between
CPU SIFT and CUDA SIFT.  The orientation vector is bytes in CPU SIFT
and floats in CUDA SIFT.  Right now I'm setting itsM = score.  I'm not
sure if that is right.

In CPU SIFT:

  float itsX;                        //!< our x coordinate
  float itsY;                        //!< our y coordinate
  float itsS;                        //!< our scale coordinate
  float itsO;                        //!< our orientation
  float itsM;                        //!< our DoG magnitude, for sorting
  std::vector<byte> itsOriFV;        //!< our Ori feature vector
  std::vector<byte> itsColFV;        //!< our color feature vector
  float itsOriWeight;                //!< The weight for ori
  float itsColWeight;                //!< The weight for col

In CUDA SIFT:

typedef struct {
  float xpos;
  float ypos;
  float scale;
  float sharpness;
  float edgeness;
  float orientation;
  float score;
  float ambiguity;
  int match;
  float match_xpos;
  float match_ypos;
  float match_error;
  float empty[4];
  float data[128];
} SiftPoint;
