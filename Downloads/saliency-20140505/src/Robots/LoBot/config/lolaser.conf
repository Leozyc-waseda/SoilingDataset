# lolaser.conf -- sample configuration file for the lolaser program
#
# This file serves as a reference for the different settings that can be
# tweaked for different parts of the lolaser program. It is not meant to
# be edited and used on a regular basis as it is checked into the svn
# repository and we wouldn't want that file to be constantly updated
# (e.g., after some experimental knob twiddling).
#
# To play around with various settings, it would be better to copy this
# file to ~/.lolaserrc and edit that instead.
#
# The syntax of this file closely matches that of INI files often found
# on the Windows platform. Briefly, here are the sytax rules:
#
#     1. Blank lines and comments are ignored.
#
#     2. Only single-line comments are supported.
#
#     3. Comments are started by a '#' or ';' character.
#
#     4. Comments must appear on lines by themselves (i.e., config lines
#        cannot have comments in them).
#
#     5. Config lines can be either section names or key-value
#        assignments.
#
#     6. Section names must start with a letter and may be
#        followed by letters, numbers or the underscore character.
#
#     7. Section names have to be enclosed in square brackets, i.e., '['
#        and ']'.
#
#     8. The key name in a key-value assignment follow the
#        same rules as section names (except that they should not be
#        enclosed in square brackets).
#
#     9. The key name must be followed by an equals sign (which may be
#        surrounded by optional whitespace).
#
#    10. The value must follow the equals sign in a key-value assignment
#        statement.
#
#    11. All tokens following the equals sign (disregarding optional
#        trailing whitespace after the equals sign) comprise the value
#        portion of the key-value statement.
#
#    12. Long key-value statements may be broken up across multiple
#        lines and continued from one line to the next by ending each
#        line with a '\' character. Note that the '\' must be the last
#        character on the line, i.e., it should be immediately followed
#        by a newline and no other trailing whitespace should appear
#        between the '\' and the newline.
#
#        All initial whitespace on the following line will be discarded.
#        Thus, to break up a really long string across multiple lines,
#        don't have any whitespace between the '\' at the end of lines
#        and the immediately preceding character. However, to ensure
#        that tokens on the following lines are considered separate, put
#        some intervening whitespace between the '\' and the previous
#        character.
#
#        The '\' line continuation characters themselves are not part of
#        the value portion of key-value statements.
#
#    13. The value portion of a key-value statement is taken verbatim,
#        i.e., there is no notion of quoting strings and/or escape
#        sequences; the whitespace following the equals sign is ignored
#        and then all characters up to the end of the line are taken as
#        the value corresponding to the specified key.
#
# Simplifying the above legalese: to get things right, just follow the
# pattern laid out in this file. Straying from the above rules and the
# syntax illustrated in this file will probably lead to errors (usually
# of the worst kind, i.e., silent assumptions of weird intent). The code
# that parses this file is mostly just a quick-and-dirty hack and has
# not been tested extensively to iron out all possible bugs. So try not
# to push the envelope here; the basic config file syntax rules are more
# than adequate for most purposes.

#--------------------------- GLOBAL SETTINGS ----------------------------

#--------------------------- DEVICE SETTINGS ----------------------------

# This section specifies settings for various aspects related to the
# connection between the host system and the laser range finder device.
[device]

# The Hokuyo laser range finder may be connected to the host system via
# USB or a serial port. The following setting specifies which one to use
# when trying to connect.
port = /dev/ttyACM0

# The communication speed between host and device
baud_rate = 115200

# The laser range finder's test program continuously retrieves the
# latest set of distance readings from the device and paints them on the
# screen. This setting specifies the frequency with which these updates
# should be performed. It is expected to be a time expressed in
# milliseconds. Thus, for some value N, the update will be performed
# once every N milliseconds.
update_frequency = 250

# In the visualization window, the laser range finder is depicted as a
# combination of a rectangle and a triangle. If this figure were drawn
# with the triangle pointed upward, it would have the shape of a house.
# However, it is not necessary that the LRF be drawn pointing up. The
# following two settings specify the size and direction of the LRF.
# 
# The direction is simply an angle in the range 0 to 360 degrees with
# zero degrees corresponding to the positive x-axis and angles going
# counter-clockwise. Negative (i.e. clockwise) angles are also allowed.
# 
# The dimensions of the LRF representation are specified in terms of the
# half-size of the shared edge between the rectangle and triangle. If
# this size is R, then the entire figure will be inscribed within an
# imaginary square of size 2R.
# 
# NOTE: As the visualization window's logical/world coordinate system is
# setup to match the Hokuyo's specs, the units of the above-mentioned R
# will be millimeters. However, these are "logical" not true physical
# mm.
lrf_size = 50
#lrf_direction = -90

# This setting specifies the color for the rectangle + triangle used to
# represent the laser range finder within the visualization window.
lrf_color = 255 48 48

#-------------------------- ZOOM/PAN SETTINGS ---------------------------

# This section specifies settings for the visualization window's
# zoom/pan parameters.
[zoom_pan]

# The allowable range of zoom levels
zoom_range = 0.05 50

# We can speed up or slow down the zoom by adjusting this factor.
# Higher values will result in amplifying mouse motion so that even a
# small movement results in a large zoom in or out; lower values will
# damp the mouse motion so that more dragging is required to achieve the
# desired zoom level.
zoom_drag_factor = 0.1

#-------------------- MEASUREMENTS RELATED SETTINGS ---------------------

# This section specifies settings for the measurements that are drawn in
# the LRF tester's window.
[measurements]

# The LRF returns distance measurements corresponding to a range of
# angles with zero degrees being in front of the device, negative angles
# on the right and positive angles on the left.  Drawing the
# measurements for all the angles in the device's range can result in a
# very cluttered and illegible picture. This setting specifies the range
# of angles to use and the step size by which to increment the angle as
# we iterate through this range.
angles_range = -135 135
angles_step  = 5

# The color in which to render the distance measurements
color = 0 192 192

#---------------------- MARKINGS RELATED SETTINGS -----------------------

# This section allows users to tweak various aspects of the regular
# markings used to help make it easier to read the distance measurements
# being returned by the laser range finder.
[markings]

# The laser range finder's distance measurements are depicted as rays
# emanating from the device (which is shown as a small upward pointing
# triangle). To make it easier to read the values of these distances,
# the LRF test program puts markers at regular intervals.
#
# This setting specifies the kind of markers we want.
type = rings
#type = grid

# This setting specifies the intervals at which the markings should be
# placed. Since the Hokuyo laser range finder returns distances in
# millimeters, these intervals are also specified in mm.
intervals = 100 500 1000 5000

# For each of the above intervals, we specify a corresponding color and
# zoom range. The markers for that interval will be drawn in the
# specified color and will only be visible at zoom levels lying in the
# given range.
color_100 = 48 48 48
zoom_100  = 7.5 1000

color_500 = 96 96 96
zoom_500  = 5 1000

color_1000 = 128 128 0
zoom_1000  = 3 1000

color_5000 = 128 0 0
zoom_5000  = 0.05 1000

# In addition to the interval markings, we can also choose to draw the
# main axes. The following setting specifies the color in which the main
# axes should be drawn. If this setting is not explicitly configured,
# the main axes will not be drawn.
main_axes_color = 255 255 255
