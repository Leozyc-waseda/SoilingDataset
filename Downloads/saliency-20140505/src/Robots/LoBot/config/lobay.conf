# lobay.conf -- sample configuration file for the lobay program
#
# This file serves as a reference for the different settings that can be
# tweaked for different parts of the lobay Robolocust metrics log
# analysis program. It is not meant to be edited and used on a regular
# basis as it is checked into the svn repository and we wouldn't want
# that file to be constantly updated (e.g., after some experimental knob
# twiddling).
#
# To play around with various settings, it would be better to copy this
# file to ~/.lobayrc and edit that instead.
#
# The syntax of this file closely matches that of INI files often found
# on the Windows platform. Briefly, here are the sytax rules:
#
#     1. Blank lines and comments are ignored.
#
#     2. Only single-line comments are supported.
#
#     3. Comments are started by a '#' or ';' character.
#
#     4. Comments must appear on lines by themselves (i.e., config lines
#        cannot have comments in them).
#
#     5. Config lines can be either section names or key-value
#        assignments.
#
#     6. Section names must start with a letter and may be
#        followed by letters, numbers or the underscore character.
#
#     7. Section names have to be enclosed in square brackets, i.e., '['
#        and ']'.
#
#     8. The key name in a key-value assignment follow the
#        same rules as section names (except that they should not be
#        enclosed in square brackets).
#
#     9. The key name must be followed by an equals sign (which may be
#        surrounded by optional whitespace).
#
#    10. The value must follow the equals sign in a key-value assignment
#        statement.
#
#    11. All tokens following the equals sign (disregarding optional
#        trailing whitespace after the equals sign) comprise the value
#        portion of the key-value statement.
#
#    12. Long key-value statements may be broken up across multiple
#        lines and continued from one line to the next by ending each
#        line with a '\' character. Note that the '\' must be the last
#        character on the line, i.e., it should be immediately followed
#        by a newline and no other trailing whitespace should appear
#        between the '\' and the newline.
#
#        All initial whitespace on the following line will be discarded.
#        Thus, to break up a really long string across multiple lines,
#        don't have any whitespace between the '\' at the end of lines
#        and the immediately preceding character. However, to ensure
#        that tokens on the following lines are considered separate, put
#        some intervening whitespace between the '\' and the previous
#        character.
#
#        The '\' line continuation characters themselves are not part of
#        the value portion of key-value statements.
#
#    13. The value portion of a key-value statement is taken verbatim,
#        i.e., there is no notion of quoting strings and/or escape
#        sequences; the whitespace following the equals sign is ignored
#        and then all characters up to the end of the line are taken as
#        the value corresponding to the specified key.
#
# Simplifying the above legalese: to get things right, just follow the
# pattern laid out in this file. Straying from the above rules and the
# syntax illustrated in this file will probably lead to errors (usually
# of the worst kind, i.e., silent assumptions of weird intent). The code
# that parses this file is mostly just a quick-and-dirty hack and has
# not been tested extensively to iron out all possible bugs. So try not
# to push the envelope here; the basic config file syntax rules are more
# than adequate for most purposes.

# NOTE: This "default" config file is setup to have lobay run on iCore.

# names.

# Each of the directories specified by the previous two settings will
# contain several log files making up a dataset for the Bayesian
# time-to-impact prediction experiments. This setting specifies a
# regular expression that defines the pattern for the names of these log
# files. The lobay program will read and parse these files and then
# write the analysis results.

# The Bayesian time-to-impact state estimator is usually configured to
# predict the TTI within the range of zero to ten seconds in steps of a
# tenth of a second. However, if the Robolocust settings for the
# Bayesian TTI prediction experiments were different, we can specify the
# maximum value for the TTI predictions with this setting, which should
# be a floating point number whose units is seconds.
# 
# When analyzing the log files for the Bayesian TTI prediction
# experiments, we will only consider those entries whose actual
# times-to-impact are less than the value of this setting because,
# eventually, the results files output by the lobay program will be used
# to produce plots showing the LGMD spike rate and TTI predictions
# versus the actual times-to-impact. Actual times-to-impact that are
# outside the range of the estimator's bounds will show up as being
# highly errorneous, which would be unfair. Therefore, we ignore such
# readings and concentrate only on those that are within the state
# estimation bounds.
