Change log for luvcview
=======================

Version 0.2.4:
- Smarter format picker. If the requested format is not available, luvcview
  now falls back to MJPG or YUYV if available.
- Made 640x480 at 30 fps the default format.
- Some optical changes to the output (and the code).

Version 0.2.3:
- Moved the sources to a new repository on svn.quickcamteam.net.
- Some changes to fix the control ID problems that affect mainly pan/tilt
  functions:
  - Remove uvc_compat.h and uvcvideo.h from the source archive. The latest
    version needs to be copied from the UVC driver repository before
	compilation.
  - Use the new 'Pan reset' and 'Tilt reset' controls.
  - Use dynctrl-logitech.h for the pan/tilt reset control.
  - Fixed the auto white balance control property to use the one in V4L2.
- The --help command line option now also shows the usage (like -h).
- Some cleanup patches by Moritz Barsnick for better error reporting and nicer
  source code.

Version 0.2.2:
- Add picture in YUYV mode
- Picture name is now P-date-times

Version 0.2.1:
- Add from Joshua Phillips:
  "That said, at the current time, the interface in luvcview (v4l2uvc.h and
  v4l2uvc.c) does not have a function to set pan and tilt simultaneously.
  Since I needed this functionality, I decided to implement it and I have
  attached my patch for the two aforementioned files. Maybe they will be
  of use to you or anyone else who wishes to use these tools in the future."
