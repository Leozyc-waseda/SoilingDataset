======================================================================

    This file contains a listing of programs that were previously part
    of the toolkit but which have removed for one reason or
    another. In some cases, a program may have been removed because
    its functionality is provided by another program in a more general
    or featureful way.

======================================================================

* [2007-01-30] [rjpeters] Removed test-new-Pixels

  Merged these tests into TestSuite/whitebox-Pixels.C, so that they
  will be run regularly as part of the test suite.

* [2007-01-30] [rjpeters] Removed test-Xwin

  To get similar functionality for tracing X events in an XWinManaged,
  try this:

    bin/stream --in=colorbars:4Hz --out=display --trace-x-events

  and then make some key presses or mouse button presses in the
  colorbars window.

* [2007-02-07] [itti] Removed executables which are unused and unmaintained

  Things marked as [unused] below were compiling and possibly working
  fine, just usually their functionality was so limited they they were
  not being used, or they applied to hardware setups which are not
  contemporary anymore. Things marked as [obsolete] had been
  unmaintained for so long, and had undergone so many unchecked source
  code update so that they would keep compiling, that probably they
  did not work anymore. If a newer program may be used as a
  replacement, sometimes it is indicated as well.

  The cleanup was based on looking at saliency/deathlist.txt at
  revision 8249, and the deletions were committed into revision 8250.

* [2007-02-07] [rjpeters] Removed test-color (testing CompositeColorChannel)

  use bin/ezvision --vc-chans=S --compcolor-double-weight=1.0 --compcolor-single-weight=0.00001

* [2007-02-07] [rjpeters] Removed test-junction

  use bin/ezvision --vc-chans=OL:2T:2X:2E

* [2007-02-08] [rjpeters] Removed mpgsize

  use bin/stream --out=info instead

* [2007-02-08] [itti] Removed PVM support

  We only used pvm for one application, a parallel saliency program
  (Parallel/pvision-master.C and Parallel/pvision.C). This was very
  slow compared to our own TCP transport library (see src/Beowulf/).

  If you ever need to write PVM code, have a look at revisions 8263 or
  earlier for how to set this up in configure.ac and depoptions.in.

* [2007-02-20] [rjpeters] Removed deprecated QuickTimeDecoder/QuickTimeParser/QuickTimeUtil

  These classes relied on QuickDraw APIs that are deprecated starting
  with OSX 10.4. They are replaced by QuartzQuickTimeDecoder and
  QuartzQuickTimeParser classes that use the officially-sanctioned
  Quartz 2D APIs.

* [2007-04-17] [rjpeters] Removed ImageDisplay class and test-ImageDisplay

  For direct window management ImageDisplay is superseded by enhanced
  functionality in XWinManaged itself, and for handling multiple
  output streams ImageDisplay is superseded by ImageDisplayStream
  (which can be used as part of an OutputFrameSeries by requesting
  --out=display).
